Welcome to GaussOpt's documentation!
====================================

*Analyze quasi-optical systems using Gaussian beam analysis*

Quasi-optical analysis is important whenever the wavelength is comparable to the size of the optical components. Gaussian beam analysis of quasi-optical systems assumes that the transverse amplitude profile (the E- or H-field) of the beam is similar to a Gaussian function. This is roughly true for beams originating from waveguide horn antennas.

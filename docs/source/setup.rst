Getting Started
===============

Installing GaussOpt Through Pip
-------------------------------

The easiest way to install ``GaussOpt`` is using ``pip``:

.. code-block:: bash
   
   pip install GaussOpt

Downloading the Repository
--------------------------

The full ``GaussOpt`` repository is hosted on `GitHub`_. To clone the repository, open a terminal window, navigate to the directory in which you would like to put GaussOpt, and then run:

.. _GitHub: https://github.com/garrettj403/GaussOpt/

.. code-block:: bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/garrettj403/GaussOpt.git GaussOpt

This will download GaussOpt into a new directory called ``GaussOpt/``. You then need to add the ``GaussOpt/`` directory to your ``PYTHONPATH`` environment variable.
